            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated Physics graduate with a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree, driven by a strong passion for research and discovery. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid theoretical and experimental physics foundation, and I am eager to further advance my expertise by pursuing a PhD.

Throughout my studies, I have developed a keen interest in exploring complex scientific problems and contributing to advancing knowledge through rigorous research. My experience includes conducting in-depth research projects, analysing data, and presenting findings in academic and collaborative settings. I am particularly interested in fields such as [your specific field of interest, e.g., quantum mechanics, astrophysics, or condensed matter physics].

I am committed to contributing meaningfully to the scientific community and excited to embark on the next stage of my academic career as a PhD candidate, where I aim to expand my research horizons and work alongside experts in the field.</p>
